# Calendar

This repo contains the academic calendar and class schedule for MAP1 (Mobile Application Development 1) program in Fanshawe College, also the code to generate the ics calendar.

## Academic Calendar

The academic calendar was generated by ChatGPT using the following prompt:

```
Below is a list of time and event, and I would like you to help me to generate a ics file containing all these events, please note the timezone should be America/Toronto, thanks!

<paste the list from school website here>
```

## Class Schedule

The class schedule generation takes two steps, first, please use `FanshaweWebAdvisor.py` by the following command

### Step 1

```bash
# install deps if running the first time
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# run the script
python3 -W ignore FanshaweWebAdvisor.py
```
Fanshawe WebAdvisor will be opened in a new browser window, after that, please use your credential to login and waiting for the browser to redirect. After that, select the term you would like to get.

### Step 2

Copy paste the result to `input.txt` in the same directory. Note that each segment were separated by `\\t`, please make sure your terminal or editor does not convert them into spaces. Then check the `schedule2ics.js` file, and set the `TZDIFF` variable to the time difference of your computer timezone to UTC time (I know this is kinda stupid). Finally, run the following command, and you will get `output.ics` as the output.

```bash
# install deps if running the first time
yarn install

# run the script
node schedule2ics.js
```

## Use the ics file

You can host the ics file and subscribe to it using your favourite calendar application, or you could simply import them.
